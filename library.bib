abstract = {We calculate the dynamical tides raised on a nonrotating solar-type star by a close stellar or planetary companion. Dissipation arising from a turbulent viscosity operating in the convection zone and radiative damping in the radiative core are considered. We compute the torque exerted on the star by a companion in circular orbit and determine the potentially observable magnitude of the tidally induced velocity at the stellar photosphere. These calculations are compared to the results obtained by assuming that a very small frequency limit can be taken in order to calculate the tidal response (equilibrium tide). For a standard solar model the latter is found to give a relatively poor approximation at the periods of interest of several days, even when the system is far from resonance with a normal mode. This behavior is caused by the small value of the Brunt-V{\"{a}}is{\"{a}}l{\"{a}} frequency in the interior regions of the convection zone. It is shown that although the companion may go through a succession of resonances as it spirals in under the action of the tides, for a fixed spectrum of normal modes its migration is controlled essentially by the nonresonant interaction. We find that the turbulent viscosity that is required to provide the observed circularization rates of main-sequence solar-type binaries is about 50 times larger than that simply estimated from mixing-length theory for nonrotating stars. We discuss the means by which this enhanced viscosity might be realized. These calculations are applied to 51 Pegasi. We show that the perturbed velocity induced by the tides at the stellar surface is too small to be observed. This result is insensitive to the magnitude of the turbulent viscosity assumed and is not affected by the possibility of resonance. For this system the stellar rotation and the orbital motion are expected to be synchronized if the mass of the companion is as much as 1/10 M⊙.},

abstract = {We substantially update the capabilities of the open-source software instrument Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA). MESA can now simultaneously evolve an interacting pair of differentially rotating stars undergoing transfer and loss of mass and angular momentum, greatly enhancing the prior ability to model binary evolution. New MESA capabilities in fully coupled calculation of nuclear networks with hundreds of isotopes now allow MESA to accurately simulate the advanced burning stages needed to construct supernova progenitor models. Implicit hydrodynamics with shocks can now be treated with MESA, enabling modeling of the entire massive star lifecycle, from pre-main-sequence evolution to the onset of core collapse and nucleosynthesis from the resulting explosion. Coupling of the GYRE non-adiabatic pulsation instrument with MESA allows for new explorations of the instability strips for massive stars while also accelerating the astrophysical use of asteroseismology data. We improve the treatment of mass accretion, giving more accurate and robust near-surface profiles. A new MESA capability to calculate weak reaction rates " on-the-fly " from input nuclear data allows better simulation of accretion induced collapse of massive white dwarfs and the fate of some massive stars. We discuss the ongoing challenge of chemical diffusion in the strongly coupled plasma regime, and exhibit improvements in MESA that now allow for the simulation of radiative levitation of heavy elements in hot stars. We close by noting that the MESA software infrastructure provides bit-for-bit consistency for all results across all the supported platforms, a profound enabling capability for accelerating MESAʼs development.},

abstract = {A hot Jupiter transiting a m V = 7.6 A-star. ABSTRACT In this paper we present MASCARA-2 b, a hot Jupiter transiting the m V = 7.6 A2 star HD 185603. It is the second planet discovered with the Multi-site All-Sky CAmeRA (MASCARA), which is specifically designed to find the brightest transiting planetary systems in the sky (m V {\textless} 8.4). Since early 2015, the northern station has taken more than 1.6 million flux measurements of the star, corre-sponding to a total of almost 3000 hours of observations, revealing it transits every 3.474135 ± 0.00001 days with a depth of 1.4{\%}. Photometric follow-up observations with the NITES and IAC80 telescopes were used to confirm the transits. We obtained spectro-scopic measurements with the SONG telescope to characterize the host star and to measure the radial velocities induced by the planet. In addition we observed two transits spectroscopically to measure the obliquity. The planet has a radius of 2.2 +0.5 −0.3 R J and a 99{\%} upper limit on the mass of {\textless} 15 M J . Contrary to most other hot Jupiters transiting early-type stars, the projected planet orbital axis and stellar spin axis are found to be aligned. We expect MASCARA to reveal many more bright transiting systems. Of the fourteen transiting planetary systems with m V {\textless} 8.4 known to date only two are located in the southern hemisphere. A second MASCARA station at the European Southern Observatory at La Silla, Chile, will start operations from July 2017 to unveil this planet population in the southern hemisphere.},

abstract = {Spectroscopic evidence for a probable brown dwarf companion to the solar-type star HD114762 is presented. This star undergoes periodic variations in radial velocity which is attributed here to orbital motion resulting from the presence of an unseen companion. The rather short period of 84 days places the companion in an orbit similar to that of Mercury around the sun, whereas the rather low velocity amplitude of about 0.6 km/s implies that the mass of the companion may be as low as 0.011 solar mass, or 11 Jupiter masses. This leads to the suggestion that the companion is probably a brown dwarf, and may even be a giant planet. However, because the inclination of the orbit to the line of sight is unknown, the mass of the companion may be considerably larger than this lower limit.},

abstract = {We report the radial-velocity discovery of a second planetary mass companion to the K0 V star HD 37605, which was already known to host an eccentric, P{\~{}}55 days Jovian planet, HD 37605b. This second planet, HD 37605c, has a period of {\~{}}7.5 years with a low eccentricity and an Msini of {\~{}}3.4 MJup. Our discovery was made with the nearly 8 years of radial velocity follow-up at the Hobby-Eberly Telescope and Keck Observatory, including observations made as part of the Transit Ephemeris Refinement and Monitoring Survey (TERMS) effort to provide precise ephemerides to long-period planets for transit follow-up. With a total of 137 radial velocity observations covering almost eight years, we provide a good orbital solution of the HD 37605 system, and a precise transit ephemeris for HD 37605b. Our dynamic analysis reveals very minimal planet-planet interaction and an insignificant transit time variation. Using the predicted ephemeris, we performed a transit search for HD 37605b with the photometric data taken by the T12 0.8-m Automatic Photoelectric Telescope (APT) and the Microvariability and Oscillations of Stars (MOST) satellite. Though the APT photometry did not capture the transit window, it characterized the stellar activity of HD 37605, which is consistent of it being an old, inactive star, with a tentative rotation period of 57.67 days. The MOST photometry enabled us to report a dispositive null detection of a non-grazing transit for this planet. Within the predicted transit window, we exclude an edge-on predicted depth of 1.9{\%} at {\textgreater}{\textgreater}10sigma, and exclude any transit with an impact parameter b{\textgreater}0.951 at greater than 5sigma. We present the BOOTTRAN package for calculating Keplerian orbital parameter uncertainties via bootstrapping. We found consistency between our orbital parameters calculated by the RVLIN package and error bars by BOOTTRAN with those produced by a Bayesian analysis using MCMC.},

abstract = {We substantially update the capabilities of the open source software package Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA), and its one-dimensional stellar evolution module, MESAstar. Improvements in MESAstar's ability to model the evolution of giant planets now extends its applicability down to masses as low as one-tenth that of Jupiter. The dramatic improvement in asteroseismology enabled by the space-based Kepler and CoRoT missions motivates our full coupling of the ADIPLS adiabatic pulsation code with MESAstar. This also motivates a numerical recasting of the Ledoux criterion that is more easily implemented when many nuclei are present at non-negligible abundances. This impacts the way in which MESAstar calculates semi-convective and thermohaline mixing. We exhibit the evolution of 3–8 M stars through the end of core He burning, the onset of He thermal pulses, and arrival on the white dwarf cooling sequence. We implement diffusion of angular momentum and chemical abundances that enable calculations of rotating-star models, which we compare thoroughly with earlier work. We introduce a new treatment of radiation-dominated envelopes that allows the uninterrupted evolution of massive stars to core collapse. This enables the generation of new sets of supernovae, long gamma-ray burst, and pair-instability progenitor models. We substantially modify the way in which MESAstar solves the fully coupled stellar structure and composition equations, and we show how this has improved the scaling of MESA's calculational speed on multi-core processors. Updates to the modules for equation of state, opacity, nuclear reaction rates, and atmospheric boundary conditions are also provided. We describe the MESA Software Development Kit that packages all the required components needed to form a unified, maintained, and well-validated build environment for MESA. We also highlight a few tools developed by the community for rapid visualization of MESAstar results.},

abstract = {Hundreds of substellar companions to solar-type stars will be discovered with the Kepler satellite. Kepler's extreme photometric precision gives access to low-amplitude stellar variability contributed by a variety of physical processes. We discuss in detail the periodic flux modulations arising from the tidal force on the star due to a substellar companion. An analytic expression for the variability is derived in the equilibrium-tide approximation. We demonstrate analytically and through numerical solutions of the linear, nonadiabatic stellar oscillation equations that the equilibrium-tide formula works extremely well for stars of mass {\textless}1.4 Msun with thick surface convection zones. More massive stars with largely radiative envelopes do not conform to the equilibrium-tide approximation and can exhibit flux variations {\$}\backslashga{\$}10 times larger than naive estimates. Over the full range of stellar masses considered, we treat the oscillatory response of the convection zone by adapting a prescription that A. J. Brickhill developed for pulsating white dwarfs. Compared to other sources of periodic variability, the ellipsoidal lightcurve has a distinct dependence on time and system parameters. We suggest that ellipsoidal oscillations induced by giant planets may be detectable from as many as {\~{}}100 of the 10{\^{}}5 Kepler target stars. (Abridged)},

Asteroseismology is proving to be particularly significant for the study of solar-type and red-giant stars. These stars show rich spectra of solar-like oscillations, which are excited and intrinsically damped by turbulence in the outermost layers of the convective envelopes. In this review we discuss the current state of the field, with a particular emphasis on recent advances provided by the Kepler and CoRoT space missions and the wider significance to astronomy of the results from asteroseismology, such as stellar populations studies and exoplanet studies.},

abstract = {Close-in, massive exoplanets raise significant tides in their stellar hosts. We compute the radial velocity (RV) signal due to this fluid motion in the equilibrium tide approximation. The predicted radial velocities in the observed sample of exoplanets exceed 1 m/s for 17 systems, with the largest predicted signal being {\~{}}30 m/s for WASP-18 b. Tidally-induced RV's are thus detectable with present methods. Both tidal fluid flow and the epicyclic motion of a slightly eccentric orbit produce an RV signal at twice the orbital frequency. If care is not taken, the tidally induced RV may, in some cases, be confused with a finite orbital eccentricity. Indeed, WASP-18 b is reported to have an eccentric orbit with small e=0.009 and pericenter longitude $\backslash$omega=-$\backslash$pi/2. Whereas such a close alignment of the orbit and line of sight to the observer requires fine tuning, this phase in the RV signal is naturally explained by the tidal velocity signature of an e=0 orbit. Additionally, the equilibrium tide estimate for the amplitude is in rough agreement with the data. Thus the reported eccentricity for WASP-18 b is instead likely a signature of the tidally-induced RV in the stellar host. Measurement of both the orbital and tidal velocity for non-transiting planets may allow planet mass and inclination to be separately determined solely from radial velocity data. We suggest that high precision fitting of RV data should include the tidal velocity signal in those cases where it may affect the determination of orbital parameters.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT In the light of recent significant progress on both the observational and theoretical fronts, we review the status of white dwarf stars as cosmochronometers. These objects represent the end products of stellar evolution for the vast majority of stars and, as such, can be used to constrain the ages of various populations of evolved stars in the Galaxy. For example, the oldest white dwarfs in the solar neighborhood (the remnants of the very first generation of intermediate‐mass stars in the Galactic disk) are still visible and can be used, in conjunction with cooling theory, to estimate the age of the disk. More recent observations suggest the tantalizing possibility that a population of very old white dwarfs inhabits the Galactic halo. Such a population may contribute significantly to baryonic “dark” matter in the Milky Way and may be used to obtain an independent estimate of the age of the halo. In addition, white dwarf cosmochronology is likely to play a very significant role in the coming era o...},

abstract = {We calculate the dynamical tides raised on a non-rotating solar-type star by a close stellar or planetary companion. Dissipation arising from a turbulent viscosity operating in the convection zone and radiative damping in the radiative core are considered. We compute the torque exerted on the star by a companion in circular orbit, and determine the potentially observable magnitude of the tidally induced velocity at the stellar photosphere. These calculations are compared with the results obtained by assuming that a very small frequency limit can be taken in order to calculate the tidal response (equilibrium tide). For a standard solar model, the latter is found to give a relatively poor approximation at the periods of interest of several days, even when the system is far from resonance with a normal mode. It is shown that although the companion may go through a succession of resonances as it spirals in under the action of the tides, for a fixed spectrum of normal modes its migration is controlled essentially by the non-resonant interaction. We find that the turbulent viscosity that is required to provide the observed circularization rates of main sequence solar-type binaries is about fifty times larger than that simply estimated from mixing length theory for non-rotating stars. We discuss the means by which this enhanced viscosity might be realized. These calculations are applied to 51 Pegasi. We show that the perturbed velocity induced by the tides at the stellar surface is too small to be observed.},

abstract = {Stellar physics and evolution calculations enable a broad range of research in astrophysics. Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) is a suite of open source, robust, efficient, thread-safe libraries for a wide range of applications in computational stellar astrophysics. A one-dimensional stellar evolution module, MESA star, combines many of the numerical and physics modules for simulations of a wide range of stellar evolution scenarios ranging from very low mass to massive stars, including advanced evolutionary phases. MESA star solves the fully coupled structure and composition equations simultaneously. It uses adaptive mesh refinement and sophisticated timestep controls, and supports shared memory parallelism based on OpenMP. State-of-the-art modules provide equation of state, opacity, nuclear reaction rates, element diffusion data, and atmosphere boundary conditions. Each module is constructed as a separate Fortran 95 library with its own explicitly defined public interface to facilitate independent development. Several detailed examples indicate the extensive verification and testing that is continuously performed and demonstrate the wide range of capabilities that MESA possesses. These examples include evolutionary tracks of very low mass stars, brown dwarfs, and gas giant planets to very old ages; the complete evolutionary track of a 1 M star from the pre-main sequence (PMS) to a cooling white dwarf; the solar sound speed profile; the evolution of intermediate-mass stars through the He-core burning phase and thermal pulses on the He-shell burning asymptotic giant branch phase; the interior structure of slowly pulsating B Stars and Beta Cepheids; the complete evolutionary tracks of massive stars from the PMS to the onset of core collapse; mass transfer from stars undergoing Roche lobe overflow; and the evolution of helium accretion onto a neutron star.

It shows how the technology pieces and their development fit together to achieve the primary goal of the strategy: if planets like Earth exist around stars within some tens of light years of our own Solar System, those planets will be found and their basic properties characterized. Essential to this strategy is not only the search for and examination of individual planets, but also a knowledge of the arrangement, or architecture, of planetary systems around as large a number of stars as possible; this is the second goal of the strategy. The final goal of the strategy is the study of disks around stars, important both to understand the implications of the variety of exoplanet systems for planet formation, and to determine how many nearby stars have environments around them clean enough of debris that planets may be sought and, if found, characterized.},

abstract = {The NASA TESS mission will deliver hundreds of transiting exoplanet candidates orbiting bright stars. The spectrometers SOPHIE at OHP and SPIRou at CFHT will be ideal to obtain radial velocities of these candidates, confirm their nature, and derive the planets' masses. These measurements will be crucial to deliver the best targets for atmospheric characterization with JWST. Here, we calculate the required observing time with SOPHIE, SPIRou, and JWST for each of the TESS targets in order to prepare follow-up observations. To infer their potential for JWST, we restrict the calculations to the case of transmission spectroscopy with NIRISS. The radial velocity follow-up of the giant planets ({\$}R{\_}p {\textgreater} 4 \backslashrm \backslash, R{\_}E{\$}) could be achieved with SOPHIE, with a median observing time of 3.47 hours per target, and a total observing time of 305 hours that includes the 80{\%} most favorable cases. Several small planets ({\$}R{\_}p {\textless} 4 \backslashrm \backslash, R{\_}E{\$}) could also be confirmed, but most of them would require an unrealistic time investment. On the other hand, SPIRou is ideally suited to the follow-up of the small planets, with a median observing time of 2.65 hours per target, and a median observing time of 4.70 hours for the terrestrial planets in the habitable zone ({\$}R{\_}p {\textless} 2 \backslashrm \backslash, R{\_}E{\$}, {\$}S {\textless} 2 \backslashrm \backslash, S{\_}E{\$}). With JWST, the 10{\%} most favorable small planets (184 planets) have a median observing time of 16.2 hours, and the 10{\%} most favorable habitable zone terrestrial planets (7 planets) have a median observing time of 59.7 hours. Overall, this study will help define a follow-up strategy and prepare observation programs with SOPHIE and SPIRou before the first planet candidates are delivered by TESS.},

abstract = {The Ancient Egyptians wrote Calendars of Lucky and Unlucky Days that assigned astronomically influenced prognoses for each day of the year. The best preserved of these calendars is the Cairo Calendar (hereafter CC) dated to 1244–1163 B.C. We have presented evidence that the 2.85 days period in the lucky prognoses of CC is equal to that of the eclipsing binary Algol during this historical era. We wanted to find out the vocabulary that represents Algol in the mythological texts of CC. Here we show that Algol was represented as Horus and thus signified both divinity and kingship. The texts describing the actions of Horus are consistent with the course of events witnessed by any naked eye observer of Algol. These descriptions support our claim that CC is the oldest preserved historical document of the discovery of a variable star. The period of the Moon, 29.6 days, has also been discovered in CC. We show that the actions of Seth were connected to this period, which also strongly regulated the times described as lucky for Heaven and for Earth. Now, for the first time, periodicity is discovered in the descriptions of the days in CC. Unlike many previous attempts to uncover the reasoning behind the myths of individual days, we discover the actual rules in the appearance and behaviour of deities during the whole year... “In 1596, Fabricius discovered the first variable star, Mira. Holwarda determined its eleven month period 44 years later. In 1669, Montanari discovered the second variable star, Algol. Goodricke determined the 2.867 days period of Algol in 1783,” Jetsu and Porceddu said. “All these astronomical discoveries were made with naked eye. Since then, they have become milestones of natural sciences... Our statistical analysis of the Cairo Calendar confirms that all these milestones should be shifted about three millennia backwards in time,” the scientists concluded.},

Recent developments, including the first systematic studies of solar-like pulsators, have boosted the impact of this field of research within astrophysics and have led to a significant increase in the size of the research community. In the present paper we start by reviewing the basic observational and theoretical properties of classical and solar-like pulsators and present results from some of the most recent and outstanding studies of these stars. We centre our review on those classes of pulsators for which interferometric studies are expected to provide a significant input. We discuss current limitations to asteroseismic studies, including difficulties in mode identification and in the accurate determination of global parameters of pulsating stars, and, after a brief review of those aspects of interferometry that are most relevant in this context, anticipate how interferometric observations may contribute to overcome these limitations. Moreover, we present results of recent pilot studies of pulsating stars involving both asteroseismic and interferometric constraints and look into the future, summarizing ongoing efforts concerning the development of future instruments and satellite missions which are expected to have an impact in this field of research.},

abstract = {Spectral line shift data obtained from full-disk magnetograms recorded at Mt. Wilson are analyzed for differential rotation. The method of analysis is discussed and the results from the data for 1966 through 1968 are presented. The average equatorial velocity over this period is found to be 1.93 km/sec or 13.76 deg/day (sidereal). This corresponds to a sidereal period of 26.16 days. The average results are$\omega$ = 2.78 × 10-6 - 3.51 × 10-7 sin2 B - 4.43 × 10-7 sin4 B rad/sec, whereB is the solar latitude. This indicates a smaller decrease of angular velocity with latitude than found by earlier investigators. Variations from day to day are caused by large-scale short-lived velocity fields on the solar surface. There also appear to be secular variations.},

@article{Quataert1995,
abstract = {We check the validity of the widely used classical apsidal motion formula as a function of orbital parameters, stellar structure, and stellar rotation rate by comparing dynamical calculations of the periastron advance with the static tidal formula. We find that the classical formula gives very accurate results when the periods of the low order quadrupole g, f and p modes are smaller than the periastron passage time by a factor of about 7 or more. However, when this condition is not satisfied, the difference between the classical formula and the exact result can be quite large, and even periastron recession can result. The largest difference arises when one of the low order modes of the star is nearly resonant with an integer multiple of the orbital frequency minus twice the rotation rate of the star. The resonance of higher order g-modes (number of radial nodes gta 4) with the orbit is very unlikely to cause significant deviation from the classical result because of their weak coupling to the tidal force and thus their small contribution to the apsidal motion. Resonances involving rotational modes of the star are also unlikely to make much contribution to the apsidal motion because of their small overlap with the tidal force, even though they have periods comparable to the periastron passage time. We apply our work to two famous binary systems (AS Cam and DI Her) which show abnormally small apsidal motion, and conclude that dynamical effects are unimportant for these systems, i.e. the static tide assumption is an excellent approximation.},

@article{Burkart2012,
abstract = {We develop a general framework for interpreting and analyzing high-precision lightcurves from eccentric stellar binaries. Although our methods are general, we focus on the recently discovered Kepler system KOI-54, a face-on binary of two A stars with {\$}e=0.83{\$} and an orbital period of 42 days. KOI-54 exhibits strong ellipsoidal variability during its periastron passage; its lightcurve also contains {\~{}}20 pulsations at perfect harmonics of the orbital frequency, and another {\~{}}10 nonharmonic pulsations. Analysis of such data is a new form of asteroseismology in which oscillation amplitudes and phases rather than frequencies contain information that can be mined to constrain stellar properties. We qualitatively explain the physics of mode excitation and the range of harmonics expected to be observed. To quantitatively model observed pulsation spectra, we develop and apply a linear, tidally forced, nonadiabatic stellar oscillation formalism including the Coriolis force. We produce temporal power spectra for KOI-54 that are semi-quantitatively consistent with the observations. Both stars in the KOI-54 system are expected to be rotating pseudosynchronously, with resonant nonaxisymmetric modes providing a key contribution to the total torque; such resonances provide a possible explanation for the two largest-amplitude harmonic pulsations observed in KOI-54, although we find quantitative problems with this interpretation. We show in detail that the nonharmonic pulsations observed in KOI-54 can be produced by nonlinear three-mode coupling. The methods developed in this paper can be generalized in the future to determine the best-fit stellar parameters given pulsation data. We also derive an analytic model of KOI-54's ellipsoidal variability, including both tidal distortion and stellar irradiation, which can be used to model other similar systems.},

@article{Lund2017,
abstract = {We report the discovery of KELT-20b, a hot Jupiter transiting a V{\~{}}7.6 early A star with an orbital period of P{\~{}}3.47 days. We identified the initial transit signal in KELT-North survey data. Archival and follow-up photometry, the Gaia parallax, radial velocities, Doppler tomography, and adaptive optics imaging were used to confirm the planetary nature of the companion and characterize the system. From global modeling we infer that the host star HD 185603 is a rapidly-rotating (VsinI{\~{}}120 km/s) A2V star with an effective temperature of {\$}T{\_}{\{}eff{\}}{\$}=8730K, mass of {\$}M{\_}{\{}star{\}}=1.76M{\_}{\{}sun{\}}{\$}, radius of {\$}R{\_}{\{}star{\}}=1.561R{\_}{\{}sun{\}}{\$}, surface gravity of logg=4.292, and age of {\textless}600 Myr. The planetary companion has a radius of {\$}1.735{\^{}}{\{}+0.070{\}}{\_}{\{}-0.075{\}}{\~{}}R{\_}{\{}J{\}}{\$}, a semimajor axis of {\$}a=0.0542{\^{}}{\{}+0.0014{\}}{\_}{\{}-0.0021{\}}{\$}AU, and a linear ephemeris of {\$}BJD{\_}{\{}TDB{\}}=2457503.120049 \backslashpm 0.000190 + E(3.4741070\backslashpm0.0000019){\$}. We place a {\$}3\backslashsigma{\$} upper limit of {\~{}}3.5 {\$}M{\_}{\{}J{\}}{\$} on the mass of the planet. The Doppler tomographic measurement indicates that the planetary orbit is well aligned with the projected spin-axis of the star ({\$}\backslashlambda= 3.4\backslashpm {\{}2.1{\}}{\$} degrees). The inclination of the star is constrained to be {\$}24.4{\textless}I{\_}*{\textless}155.6{\$} degrees, implying a true (three-dimensional) spin-orbit alignment of {\$}1.3{\textless}\backslashpsi{\textless}69.8{\$} degrees. The planet receives an insolation flux of {\$}\backslashsim 8\backslashtimes 10{\^{}}9{\~{}}{\{}\backslashrm erg{\~{}}s{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\~{}}cm{\^{}}{\{}-2{\}}{\}}{\$}, implying an equilibrium temperature of of {\~{}} 2250 K, assuming zero albedo and complete heat redistribution. Due to the high stellar {\$}T{\_}{\{}eff{\}}{\$}, the planet also receives an ultraviolet (wavelengths {\$}d\backslashle 91.2{\$}{\~{}}nm) insolation flux of {\$}\backslashsim 9.1\backslashtimes 10{\^{}}4{\~{}}{\{}\backslashrm erg{\~{}}s{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\~{}}cm{\^{}}{\{}-2{\}}{\}}{\$}, which may lead to significant ablation of the planetary atmosphere. Together with WASP-33, Kepler-13 A, HAT-P-57, KELT-17, and KELT-9, KELT-20 is the sixth A star host of a transiting giant planet, and the third-brightest host (in V) of a transiting planet.},
